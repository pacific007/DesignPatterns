GoF definition for facade design pattern is, “Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. 
Facade Pattern defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.”

1- Starting car involves multiple steps but it only opens simple interface to rider by just applying key, it starts.
2- When you order pizza, which internally evolves many steps to bake pizza but for you it just simplifies by ordering only.
3- A booking system example 

Let us consider an example of booking a package . Usually when you try to book a package  , the ticket booking system interacts with many of subsystems. The various sub-systems may be flight , hotel and  cab booking . In addition this may also interact with many other sub systems.

In this case instead of client having the overhead of interacting with various other subsystems , we can introduce a facade 
layer  which interacts will all these subsystems. Finally once it get the response from all the subsystems, it aggregates
all these response and send the response back to the client.
